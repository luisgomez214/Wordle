# Wordle
A python coded Wordle game (based on New York Times Game) that allows the player to play by themselves, against AI, or just watch the AI play against each other. 

Created this game as an alternative to Wordle, since it only lets you play once a day. Some other key differences is the words that are used for the dictionary are different than the ones on actual Wordle, maiking it more challenging. Also, the addition of playing against an AI allows for a new take on the game. Some may find it helpful but others may lose to the AI. Have fun!
