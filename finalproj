#CS5 Final Project

# Paul Abizer and Luis

##Starter    Starting with the example below,
#Decide on an idea for your game
#Self-designed or traditional variations are more than welcome!
#Begin implementing the play-one-round function for your game...
#Be sure your starter.py runs and plays (at least part of) one round of your game successfully.
#You'll need an opponent and/or AI (even if it always plays the same / plays randomly).
#Be sure, too, to include starter.txt with a description of your game's vision (and your final-project team).
